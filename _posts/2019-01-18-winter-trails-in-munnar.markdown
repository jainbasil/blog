Munnar, popularly known as “Kashmir of South India”, is a famous tourist destination in the Idukki district of Kerala state. Known for its picturesque hills and Neelakurinji (a shrub with purplish-blue flowers that blossoms only once in 12 years ), it is one among most sought out destinations by the tourists visiting India.

With the mercury levels touching almost zero degrees, snowfall was the main attraction that rallied tourists to Munnar in December 2018. In the meanwhile, I upgraded from 9-year-old Sony a390L DSLR to Sony ILCE-6300 and was planning for short trips to capture landscapes using my new gear. Here are some photographs I captured on a short unplanned trip to Munnar.
